# Merge_Sort_

📘 Student Record Sorting using Merge Sort
This project implements a Merge Sort-based system to efficiently organize student records by their registration dates. As academic institutions manage large datasets, sorting records accurately and quickly becomes essential for administrative tasks like admissions and enrollment.

🔍 Problem Statement
Design and develop a program that sorts student records based on their registration date (YYYY-MM-DD) using the Merge Sort algorithm. Each student record contains:

Student ID

Name

Registration Date

Age

Branch

📥 Input & 📤 Output
Input: List of student records.

Output: Sorted list in ascending and descending order of registration dates.

✅ Key Features
🔁 Efficient: Uses Merge Sort (O(n log n)) optimized for large datasets.

🧩 Stable: Maintains original order of records with the same registration date.

📈 Scalable: Consistent performance as data size increases.

✔️ Accurate: Ensures correct chronological ordering.

🛠️ Algorithm Overview
Approach: Divide and conquer strategy

Split the list into sublists

Recursively sort each sublist

Merge sorted sublists into a final sorted list

Data Structure: Array of Student records

Sorting Key: Registration Date

🧠 Why Merge Sort?
🚀 Time Complexity: O(n log n)

🧷 Stable sort

🔗 Ideal for array and linked list implementations

This project demonstrates how a classic algorithm like Merge Sort can be practically applied to solve real-world data management challenges in academic environments.
